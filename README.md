# malware-analyzer

This project is designed to analyze the imports used by PE files and find suspicious combinations.

This project requires that this project https://github.com/merces/pev is installed on a linux system, as popen is used to call it in the main file.

After compiling with make, this project can be run by entering ./malware-analyzer <file-path> to analyze a specific file, or ./malware-analyzer -g to open the project with a gui.

This is a work in progress. More definitions, features, and code restructuring to come.
